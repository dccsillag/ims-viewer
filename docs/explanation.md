Finding Similarities Between the Images
===

We want to somehow visualize our set of images based on their similarities â€” that is, similar
images should be close together, and non-similar ones should be far away.

All the approaches given below following a common idea: map each image to some vector in
$\mathbb{R}^n$, and then use some dimensionality reduction procedure in order to visualize it.

Mapping images to vectors

### Approach #1: MobileNet Logits

This is the approach used in [Vikus Viewer](...).

#### Cosine Similarity

### Approach #2: VGG-16 Feature Vectors

This was inspired by [...](...).

Preparing the Dataset
===

When making effective interfaces, it is good practice to preprocess whatever possible to avoid
excessive computation at runtime. In this project, several things were preprocessed, and are now
explained:

Finding the images' geolocation

Finding the images' similarities

The procedure explained in the "Finding Similarities Between the Images" section.

All that is stored in the database is the X and Y coordinates of the t-SNE visualization of the
images' vectors.
